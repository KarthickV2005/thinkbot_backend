Project Idea: Decentralized Academic Certificate Verification System

Description:
Educational certificates and transcripts are often prone to forgery and delays in verification. 
This project aims to create a blockchain-powered decentralized platform for issuing, storing, 
and verifying academic certificates.

Key Features:
1. Universities can issue tamper-proof digital certificates on the blockchain.
2. Students receive a unique, verifiable digital identity linked to their certificates.
3. Employers and institutions can instantly verify the authenticity of certificates without intermediaries.
4. Smart contracts ensure certificates cannot be altered or duplicated once issued.
5. Transparency and trust are maintained through decentralized ledger technology.

Tech Stack:
- Blockchain: Ethereum / Polygon / Hyperledger Fabric
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Frontend: React.js / Next.js
- Backend: Node.js / Express
- Database (for metadata): IPFS / MongoDB

Impact:
This system eliminates certificate fraud, speeds up the hiring/admission process, and ensures global trust 
in academic records. It provides a scalable solution for universities, employers, and students worldwide.
